# RoundRobot
After a semi-successful robot project using ToF (Time of Flight) sensors for obstacle avoidance, I decided to build another robot that implemented ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance as well as added control from an app.

The .apk file is an android program file used to control a number of the arduino sketches via Bluetooth
